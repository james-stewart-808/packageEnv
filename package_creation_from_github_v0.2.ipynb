    "# Installing packages from Git/Gitlab (v0.1)\n",

    "The idea of this notebook is to implement a Github repository which can be built using bash-based Git commands from the Command Line. Two methods are presented in the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The 1st method is based on the following article, where the 'build' module needs to be installed with pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "Saba (2024, via Medium). Making a Python Github repository a package using pyproject.toml. Available at:\n",
    "https://medium.com/@savaw/making-a-python-repository-a-package-using-pyproject-toml-b115154aef77\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second method is more rudimentary, simply calling a command to clone the github repo locally and then import it from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a functionality to download packages like this will be great for running code which is hosted on Github rather than locally, where further code amendments can be test locally, committed to the local Github repo, then pushed and merged onto the master repo of the Github website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically within the UNCTAD Oceans work, it would be great to fork the 'af.get_ais()' and amend it so it filters by IMO number. This could be done with a public Github account, yet still be integrated into official UNGP AIS-TT notebooks and processes, plus reviewed, pushed and/or integrated into the official UNGP AIS-TT codebase as useful.

    "## Developing a Package from Github\n",
    "\n",
    "This method ensures that the repo is set up correctly, including with 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files (which need to be included in the package), but most crucially with a 'pyproject.toml' configuration file placed in the root directory (previously module development has required a 'setup.py' file, however this is now a depracated method). The 'pyproject.toml' configures important aspects such as project name, version and package dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method works by cloning the repo into an 'src' folder on the root directory. I think pip then sets up an 'alias' of the package (or 'builds' the package) in 'lib/python3.9/site-packages' (called something like 'test_package-0.0.1.dist-info') as this is what's on the 'sys.root' directory, allowing the package to then be imported directly into the notebook.\n",
